## Abstract:
The traditional land registry system is plagued by inefficiencies, corruption, and inaccuracies. This study proposes a blockchain-based land registry system that leverages the security, transparency, and immutability of blockchain technology to create a secure, efficient, and transparent platform for land registration. The system utilizes smart contracts to automate land registration processes, ensuring that all transactions are executed in a secure and transparent manner. The proposed system has the potential to reduce corruption, increase efficiency, and improve the overall accuracy of land ownership records.

Keywords: Land Registry, Blockchain, Smart Contracts, Security, Transparency, Efficiency.
